The system is designed to deliver personalized recommendations, simplify book discovery, and enhance the overall reading experience.


## Key Features

AI-Based Book Recommendations

User Authentication with Firebase
Secure login and registration powered by Firebase Authentication, enabling users to manage their reading preferences across sessions.

Download Tracking and Local Storage

## Technology Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend Services: Firebase Authentication, Local Storage

APIs: Gutendex API for book data

AI & Recommendation Engine: Hugging Face Sentence Transformers, Cosine Similarity


## How It Works

User signs up/logs in through Firebase Authentication.

Books are fetched dynamically from the Gutendex API and displayed.

As users download books, their reading patterns are stored locally.

The system generates embeddings of book titles/descriptions and compares them using cosine similarity to recommend books based on past downloads.

Users can interact with a chatbot for help and suggestions.


## Future Enhancements

Cloud database to sync user reading history across devices

Recommendation fine-tuning using user ratings or genres

Dark mode and UI/UX improvements

Expand chatbot capabilities using NLP frameworks
